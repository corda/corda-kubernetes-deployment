# CORDA DOCKER IMAGES

In this section we define the structure of the Docker images that our deployment will be using.

The scripts we will be using are as follows:

- ``docker_config.sh``, contains the customisation options that you can define for your deployment, for example which version of Corda Enterprise to use
- ``build_docker_images.sh``, this script will compile the Docker images based on the Docker files and necessary jars
- ``push_docker_images.sh``, this script will push the local Docker images to a remote repository, the Container Registry. Please note that your Kubernetes Cluster should have access to the Container Registry, please see root README.md for more information

## PREREQUISITES

Before executing the above mentioned scripts, the scripts need access to the Corda Enterprise binaries, these files should be placed in the ``bin``-folder, namely:

- Corda Enterprise Node jar file, e.g. [R3 Artifactory: corda-ent-4.0.jar](https://ci-artifactory.corda.r3cev.com/artifactory/corda-enterprise/com/r3/corda/corda/4.0/corda-4.0.jar)
- Corda Firewall jar file, e.g. [R3 Artifactory: corda-firewall-4.0.jar](https://ci-artifactory.corda.r3cev.com/artifactory/corda-enterprise/com/r3/corda/corda-firewall/4.0/corda-firewall-4.0.jar)
- Corda Health Survey Tool jar file, e.g. [R3 Artifactory: corda-tools-health-survey-4.2.20191122.jar](https://ci-artifactory.corda.r3cev.com/artifactory/corda-enterprise/com/r3/corda/corda-tools-health-survey/4.0/corda-tools-health-survey-4.0.jar)

Either you can download them from the [R3 Artifactory](https://ci-artifactory.corda.r3cev.com/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/corda-enterprise) (login details required) or then you may have these files shared with you separately, in which case you just have to copy them to the correct folder.

If you do not have a license for Corda Enterprise, you can apply for an evaluation version here (you have to sign the Corda evaluation license agreement): [Corda Enterprise Evaluation](https://www.r3.com/download-corda-enterprise/)

## CONFIGURATION

Main configuration options in the file ``docker_config.sh`` are as follows:

- ``DOCKER_REGISTRY``, defines the Container Registry location to use, example: <container-registry.mydomain.com>
- ``VERSION``, defines the version of Corda Enterprise we are using, default is 4.0
- ``HEALTH_CHECK_VERSION``, defines the version of the Corda Health Survey version to use, the default is 4.0, for more information see <https://solutions.corda.net/deployment/onprem/corda-health-checker.html>
- ``CORDA_DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION``, the published version number of the Docker image for the Node, the default is ``v1.00``, which you can use as starting point an increment if you make changes to your Docker file
- ``FIREWALL_DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION``, the published version number of the Docker image for the Corda Firewall, the default is ``v1.00``, which you can use as starting point an increment if you make changes to your Docker file

Fin.
